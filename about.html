                <p>I am a compassionate and intrisically driven person, who wishes to leave the world a better than place than how I found it. I am always looking to improve myself academically, socially, and mentally to become someone who I can one day look back on and be proud of. I enjoy helping others and using my creativity to solve novel problems.</p>

                <p>Known for its potatos among other things, Idaho is my hometown since birth! It's tranquil scenery makes enjoying the morning view with tea or coffee that much better. The nature makes taking pictures exciting and refreshing. I highly recommend people to visit Idaho to enjoy the outdoors life this state offers.</p>
